# json-discord-bot
A discord bot made almost entirely in JSON!

I don't know how to git or what to say here, so this is like a testing thingy

### Everything is in JSON?
##### Em, no. 
Everything is still javascript but almost everything (modules and 4 lines in index.js isn't) is just stored in JSON files.  
I'm just using eval to run code inside JSONs.  
And yes, I could write whole bot and put it inside 1 huge string in one JSON file. But I'm trying to use multiple JSON files and object properties as much as i can.   
It looks wierd, it's stoopid, I'm just having fun.  
  
You can find me on Discord @ BlackBird#1638
